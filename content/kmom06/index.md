Database driven website
===========================================

Welcome to my database driven website! It is a small website with three pages, where all content is stored in a database. The pages are:

* A home page
* An about page
* A blog with blog posts

You can view the website and also change it by adding, updating and/or deleting content in the database.

* [View the website](content/home)
* [Change the website](content/index)
