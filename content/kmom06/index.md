Database driven website
===========================================

Welcome to my database driven website! It is a small website with three pages, where all content is stored in a database. The pages are:

* A home page
* An about page
* A blog with blog posts

You can enter website in edit or view mode.

In edit mode you can add, update and delete content in the database. You need to be logged in to do that. In view mode you can see the resulting website. It gives you exactly the same pages/content but with an added navigation bar to be able to navigate between them. You can however not see deleted or not yet published pages/blogs. Also the modification date is removed from the home and about page.

* [View the website](content/index)
* [Edit the website](editContent/index)
