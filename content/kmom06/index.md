Database driven website
===========================================

Welcome to my database driven website! It is a small website with three pages, where all content is stored in a database. The pages are:

* A home page
* An about page
* A blog with blog posts

You can view the website and also edit it by adding, updating and/or deleting content in the database. Viewing the website gives you exactly the same pages but with an added navigation bar to be able to navigate between them. Also the modification date is removed from the home and about page.

* [View the website](content/index)
* [Edit the website](editContent/index)
